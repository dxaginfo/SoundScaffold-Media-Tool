# SoundScaffold - Media Automation Tool

SoundScaffold is an audio scene management tool designed to organize, analyze, and optimize audio elements within media productions. It leverages Python, TensorFlow, and Google Cloud technologies to provide automated audio scene analysis, categorization, and enhancement capabilities.

## Features

- **Audio Scene Analysis**: Analyzes audio files to identify key elements, transitions, and quality issues
- **Sound Library Management**: Organizes and categorizes sound effects and audio elements
- **Audio Enhancement**: Applies AI-driven optimizations to improve audio quality
- **Scene Mapping**: Maps audio elements to visual scenes for better synchronization
- **Continuity Checking**: Ensures audio continuity across scene transitions

## Core Components

### AudioAnalyzer

The `AudioAnalyzer` class provides functionality to analyze audio files and extract scene information, transitions, and quality metrics.

```python
from sound_scaffold import AudioAnalyzer

analyzer = AudioAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze("scene_audio.wav")
print(results['scene_breakdown'])
```

### AudioEnhancer

The `AudioEnhancer` class provides functionality to enhance audio files with various processing algorithms optimized for media production.

```python
from sound_scaffold import AudioEnhancer

enhancer = AudioEnhancer()
enhanced_file = enhancer.enhance(
    "original.wav", 
    enhancement_type="dialogue_clarity",
    options={"level": 0.7}
)
print(f"Enhanced file saved to: {enhanced_file}")
```

### SoundLibraryManager

The `SoundLibraryManager` class provides functionality to manage, categorize, and search audio files in a sound library for media production.

```python
from sound_scaffold import SoundLibraryManager

manager = SoundLibraryManager()
results = manager.search_sounds({
    "category": "ambient",
    "mood": "tense",
    "duration_max": 30
})
for sound in results:
    print(f"{sound['name']}: {sound['description']}")
```

## API Endpoints

SoundScaffold provides a RESTful API for integration with other tools:

- `POST /analyze`: Submit audio file for analysis
- `GET /analysis/{analysis_id}`: Retrieve analysis results
- `POST /enhance`: Submit audio for enhancement
- `GET /library/search`: Search sound library
- `POST /library/add`: Add to sound library
- `GET /scenes/{project_id}`: Get audio scenes for project
